# hermes-keyboard
An unusual split ortholinear/vertical-stagger keyboard build

Design choices:
- split design to allow natural wrist position
- use many layers with specialized uses so fewer keys are needed and the right keys are always within reach
- same keypress sequence on every layer to escape back to previous + default
- separate partial layers for right and left hand and for thumb input so those can be mixed and matched
- logic that connects separate layers to make it easier to remember and build muscle memory
- high tenting angle with a separate face for thumb keys for better ergonomics
- completely ditch QWERTY and start from a sensible place; what keys are used most?
- short columns so hands never need to leave the home position
- made with as many off-the-shelf or easily swappable parts, for simple repairs and inexpensive parts
- 1u keys only, so there's no messing around with stabilizers to save on time, parts, and frustration
- maximize the ability to 'roll' from one key to the next without needing to stretch fingers
- the ability to use a leader key to call up uncommon keys by name and then bind them to one or more repeat keys
- open-source design with custom, highly configurable software
- chord support for PLOVER-style input
