# hermes-keyboard
An unusual ortholinear handwired keyboard build

Design choices:
- split design with many layers, for ergonomics and so fewer keys are needed
- high tenting angle with a separate face for thumb keys for mid/high tier ergonomics
- 1u keys only, so there's no messing around with stabilizers
- made with as many off-the-shelf or easily swappable parts, for simple repairs and inexpensive parts
